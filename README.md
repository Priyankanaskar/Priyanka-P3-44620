## Matplotlib and pyplot
# Instruction:
Create a virtual environment
Activate the virtual environment
Install into the active virtual environment (e.g. `python -m pip install matplotlib`)
In your Python, import it (e.g. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)
Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).

## Objectives
This exercise is used to reinforce key Python visualization skills. It offers practice with web-enabled Jupyter notebooks and lays some important foundations for presenting information obtained from mining the web and processing language.  We'll use the MatplotlibLinks to an external site. library. The Matplotlib library includes the pyplot module which provides a simple interface for building charts. All this code is free - the more you explore, the more you can do. Your skills are limited only by the time you wish to invest. 

Anytime we use an external library (something not included in the Python Standard Library) like Matplotlib,  we'll need to:

install it into our active virtual environment and
use an import statement in our Python. 
Spelling and capitalization matters - to use a library, you might need to first search for the install commands and then find the typical way it is imported into Python. The typical approach is to:

Create a virtual environment
Activate the virtual environment
Install into the active virtual environment (e.g. `python -m pip install matplotlib`)
In your Python, import it (e.g. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)
Each question is worth two points: 

* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)
## Assignment Overview
Here's a short little video showing how to do the assignments. https://use.vg/f5lawN

# It shows how to:

get the starter repo into your GitHub account. The video uses GitHub classroom, some sections will just start with a template (like forking, but disconnects from the original starter repo). 
clone down your repo to your local machine,
start up Jupyter lab (or Jupyter Notebook),
make edits to Markdown cells and Python code cells
add and commit your changes using Git
push your commit up to the GitHub repo.
export your notebook as HTML (a web page) for submission using the menu

## Task 1. Get Started
Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.  The base repository is available at: https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/pyplot/blob/master/pyplot.ipynbLinks to an external site.
Clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.

## Task 2. Open Notebook and Complete Tasks 
On your machine, open the Jupyter Notebook for editing. 
Required: In your Markdown introduction, add a viewable, clickable link to your GitHub repo after your name. Build your brand and make your Markdown introduction clear and professional. 
Required: Use Markdown headings  (e.g. Question 1) to clearly show your content by each question number. 
Complete the first task.
Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
Complete the second task.
Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
Work this way until all tasks have been completed. 

## Task 3. Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
Execute each notebook.
After executing, export each notebook to HTML.
Commit and push your HTML files to your GitHub repo along with the executed notebooks. 
Verify you have a professional README.md that introduces your GitHub repository and provides helpful information about your project.
